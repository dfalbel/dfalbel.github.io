You can use torch on Google Colab notebooks. Here's how you do it.

Create an R notebook using the link [https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r).

Change your runtime type, if tyou want GPU support by clicking `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type` and selecting `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.

Paste the following into a new cell and run it. This installs torch from pre-built binaries which are:

1. Much faster to install since you don't need to compile the torch C++ codebase from source.
2. The pre-built binaries bundle all the necessary CUDA libraries, so you don't need to figure out
   if Colab installs a compatible version of CUDA.

```{.r}
options(timeout = 600) # increasing timeout is recommended since we will be downloading a 2GB file.
kind <- "cu118"
version <- available.packages()["torch","Version"]
options(repos = c(
  torch = sprintf("https://torch-cdn.mlverse.org/packages/%s/%s/", kind, version),
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org" # or any other from which you want to install the other R dependencies.
))
install.package("torch")
```

Use the notebook with GPU support!
