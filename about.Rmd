Welcome to this blog. After quite some time daily writing R code, I decided to put this blog to keep up some notes and help me remembering details of implementations.

Here I'll mostly talk about [torch for R](https://torch.mlverse.org) and the problems faced while implementing it.

Hopefully it's helpful for others!
